        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) designed to handle everything from small to large
            projects
            with
            speed and efficiency. It tracks changes in source code and allows multiple developers to collaborate
            on
            the
            same project.

        </p>
        <p>It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage development of Linux Kernel. Although, Git is
            highly
            popular for managing code, but can also be used to track changes in any files types- text doc.,
            images
            etc.
            Git is a tool that helps multiple people work on the same project code by tracking and managing
            changes
            to
            files.
        </p>


        <h2>Why Version Control Matters?</h2>
        <p>Version control is essential for tracking changes, collaboration, and maintaining a history of code
            changes
            over time. It allows developers to work together without overwriting each other's work.

            <br>

            Evertime anyone is making changes whether it is adding a sentence to document or alternating a line
            or
            even
            deleting some lines then the VCS records and saves the outcome with accurate timestamp.
        </p>

        <h2>Centralized vs Distributed VCS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Centralized VCS:</strong> One central server stores all files, and developers commit
                changes
                directly to it. Examples: SVN, CVS.</li>
            <li><strong>Distributed VCS:</strong> Every developer has a local copy of the project. They can work
                independently and sync changes. Example: Git.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Repository:</strong> A directory that holds the project's files and the history of all
                changes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Commit:</strong> A snapshot of your project's current state.</li>
            <li><strong>Branch:</strong> A version of the project used to work on new features without affecting
                the
                main codebase.</li>
            <li><strong>Merge:</strong> Combining different branches into one.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Version Control:</strong>Git keeps a detailed history of all changes made to a project.
                This
                includes when the change was made, who made it, and why (through commit messages).</li>
            <li><strong>Distributed System:</strong>Each developer has a complete copy of the entire project and
                its
                history on their local machine. This means that Git does not rely on a central server, and
                changes
                can
                be made and tracked even offline.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Multiple developers can work on the same project, even on the
                same
                files, without overwriting each other's work. Git handles changes by providing tools like
                branches
                and
                merges.</li>
            <li><strong>Branching and Merging:</strong>
                Git allows developers to create branches to work on features or fixes in isolation from the main
                codebase. Once the changes are complete, the branch can be merged back into the main project.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Snapshots, Not Differences:</strong>Git saves entire snapshots of your file system
                rather
                than
                recording changes line by line. This makes it more efficient in tracking history and helps in
                reverting
                back to any previous version of the project.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed and Efficiency:</strong> Git is designed to handle projects of all sizes
                efficiently,
                from
                small personal projects to large enterprise-level repositories with millions of files and
                developers.
            </li>
        </ul>
