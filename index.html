        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to
            very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows developers to track changes in source code and
            collaborate with others on shared projects.</p>

        <h2>How to Use Git</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span>1. Initialize a Repository:</span> Run <code>git init</code> in your project folder to create a
                new Git repository.</li>
            <li><span>2. Track Changes:</span> Use <code>git add file-name</code> to stage changes for commit.</li>
            <li><span>3. Commit Changes:</span> Save changes to the repository with <code>git commit -m "commit
                    message"</code>.</li>
            <li><span>4. View History:</span> Use <code>git log</code> to see the commit history and details of each
                commit.</li>
            <li><span>5. Branching:</span> Create a new branch using <code>git branch branch-name</code> and switch to
                it using <code>git checkout branch-name</code>.</li>
            <li><span>6. Merge Branches:</span> Combine changes from different branches with <code>git merge
                    branch-name</code>.</li>
            <li><span>7. Push to Remote:</span> If you're working with a remote repository (like GitHub), use
                <code>git push origin branch-name</code> to upload your changes.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fact to know?</h2>
        <p>In this scenario, when you modify a file, stage it, modify it again, and then stage the new modification
            without committing, Git will only commit the latest version of the file.</p>
        <p>Here's what happens step by step:</p>
        <p><b>Initial Modification:</b> You modify the file and stage it (git add file). At this point, the staging
            area holds the version of the file with the first modification.</p>
        <p><b>Further Modification:</b> You modify the file again and stage it once more. This overwrites the previous
            version of the file in the staging area with the latest changes.</p>
        <p><b>Commit:</b> When you commit the changes (git commit -m "This is new"), Git will commit the version of the
            file that is currently in the staging area, which is the file with the most recent modification.</p>
