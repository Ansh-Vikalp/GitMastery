    <p>In this scenario, when you modify a file, stage it, modify it again, and then stage the new modification without
        committing, Git will only commit the latest version of the file.
    </p>


    <p>Here's what happens step by step:</p>

    <p>
        Initial Modification: You modify the file and stage it (git add file). At this point, the staging area (also
        known
        as the index) holds the version of the file with the first modification.
    </p>

    <p>
        Further Modification: You modify the file again and stage it once more. This overwrites the previous version of
        the
        file in the staging area with the latest changes. Git does not keep two versions of the same file in the staging
        areaâ€”it always stores only the most recent version that was staged.
        <br>
        Commit: When you commit the changes (git commit -m "This is new"), Git will commit the version of the file that
        is
        currently in the staging area, which is the file with the most recent modification.
