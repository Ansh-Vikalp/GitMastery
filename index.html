        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to
            very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows developers to track changes in source code and
            collaborate with others on shared projects.</p>

        <h2>How to Use Git</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span>1. Initialize a Repository:</span> Run <code>git init</code> in your project folder to create a
                new Git repository.</li>
            <li><span>2. Track Changes:</span> Use <code>git add file-name</code> to stage changes for commit.</li>
            <li><span>3. Commit Changes:</span> Save changes to the repository with <code>git commit -m "commit
                    message"</code>.</li>
            <li><span>4. View History:</span> Use <code>git log</code> to see the commit history and details of each
                commit.</li>
            <li><span>5. Branching:</span> Create a new branch using <code>git branch branch-name</code> and switch to
                it using <code>git checkout branch-name</code>.</li>
            <li><span>6. Merge Branches:</span> Combine changes from different branches with <code>git merge
                    branch-name</code>.</li>
            <li><span>7. Push to Remote:</span> If you're working with a remote repository (like GitHub), use
                <code>git push origin branch-name</code> to upload your changes.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Repeted Modification</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span>1. Initial Modification:</span> You modify the file and stage it (git add file). At this point,
                the
                staging
                area holds the version of the file with the first modification.</li>
            <li><span>2. Further Modification:</span> You modify the file again and stage it once more. This overwrites
                the
                previous
                version of the file in the staging area with the latest changes.</li>
            <li><span>3. Commit Changes:</span> When you commit the changes <code>git commit -m "This is new"</code>,
                Git
                will commit the version of the
                file that is currently in the staging area, which is the file with the most recent modification.</li>
            <li><span>4. View History:</span> Use <code>git log</code> to see the commit history and details of each
                commit.</li>

        </ul>

    </section>


    <section class="git-explanation">
        <h2>Working with Remote Repository</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span>1. git pull:</span> The git pull command is used to fetch and merge changes from a remote
                repository to your local repository.
                <code>git pull origin main
            </code>
                If we have alredy used <code>git push -u origin master/main</code> Then there is no need to specify name
                of remote repo(origin) & branch (main/master).
                We can simple use <code>git pull</code>
            </li>
            <li><span>2. git push:</span> The git push command is used to send your committed changes to the remote
                repository
                <code>git push</code> will pushes the local changes in the master branch to the master branch of the
                remote repository.
            </li>
            <li><span>3. git clone:</span> The git clone command is used to create a copy of an existing remote
                repository to your local machine
                <code>git clone repository-url </code>
                The cloned repository contains all files along with tracked history of all commits so a tester can use
                these commits by git show commit-id:index.html
                or cat index.html to see content in latest commit. In case after cloning the remote repo has been alterd
                then Tester can furthur fetch the latest new changes into their cloned reop using
                <code>git pull</code> request.
            </li>
