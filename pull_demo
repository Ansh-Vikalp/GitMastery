This file is created inside remote repo "GitMastery" and we bringing this file and it's history to our local repo "LearningGit".
This is done by using git pull cmd - means bring all the latest changes from remote repo to local repo. Also we need not to use -u origin master in this case.
Because we have already configured it in our first git push cmd and is one time process. Now we can use independently git push and git pull to push or pull back changes.
