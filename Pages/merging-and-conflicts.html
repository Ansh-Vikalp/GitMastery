        <h2>What is Merging?</h2>
        <p>Merging in Git combines changes from one branch into another. This is typically done when a feature branch is
            ready to be integrated into the main branch. Merging preserves the history of both branches and helps in
            collaboration by allowing parallel development.</p>

        <h2>How to Merge Branches</h2>
        <p>To merge changes from another branch into your current branch, use the <code>git merge</code> command:</p>
        <pre><code>git merge <branch-name></code></pre>
        <p>This merges the specified branch into the branch you are currently on. For example, to merge a branch called
            <code>feature-branch</code> into the <code>main</code> branch:
        </p>
        <pre><code>git checkout main
git merge feature-branch</code></pre>
        <p>The merging process combines the histories and changes of both branches.</p>

        <h2>Fast-Forward Merge</h2>
        <p>A fast-forward merge happens when the current branch has no new commits since the branch you're merging was
            created. Instead of creating a merge commit, Git will simply move the branch pointer forward, effectively
            ‚Äúfast-forwarding‚Äù the branch:</p>
        <pre><code>git merge feature-branch</code></pre>
        <p>In this case, the commit history is linear, as the branch pointer moves to the latest commit of the feature
            branch.</p>

        <h2>3-Way Merge</h2>
        <p>A 3-way merge occurs when both branches have made unique changes since they diverged. Git uses the common
            ancestor of the two branches to merge changes, but a new commit (merge commit) will be created to record the
            combination of changes from both branches:</p>
        <pre><code>git merge feature-branch</code></pre>
        <p>This type of merge happens when there are divergent changes, and Git needs to reconcile differences between
            the branches.</p>

        <h2>Merge Conflicts</h2>
        <p>Merge conflicts occur when both branches have made changes to the same lines of code or file. In such cases,
            Git will pause the merge and allow you to resolve the conflict manually. When a conflict happens, Git will
            insert conflict markers into the affected files, and you will need to decide which changes to keep.</p>
        <pre><code><<<<<<< HEAD
// Your changes
=======
 // Other branch changes
>>>>>>> feature-branch</code></pre>
        <p>To resolve the conflict, you must edit the file and choose which lines to keep or combine, then remove the
            conflict markers.</p>

        <h2>How to Resolve Merge Conflicts</h2>
        <p>After resolving the conflict in the file, you need to stage the changes and commit them. Here‚Äôs the process:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Edit the conflicting files to resolve the conflicts.</li>
            <li>Stage the resolved files using <code>git add</code>:</li>
            <pre><code>git add <filename></code></pre>
            <li>Commit the merge using <code>git commit</code>:</li>
            <pre><code>git commit</code></pre>
        </ol>
        <p>Once committed, the merge is complete, and the combined changes will be part of the current branch.</p>

        <h2>Viewing Merge Conflicts</h2>
        <p>To see which files have conflicts during a merge, use <code>git status</code>. It will show you which files
            are unmerged and need attention:</p>
        <pre><code>git status</code></pre>

        <h2>Aborting a Merge</h2>
        <p>If the merge is too complex or you decide not to merge at all, you can cancel the merge process with:</p>
        <pre><code>git merge --abort</code></pre>
        <p>This will revert your working directory to the state before the merge attempt.</p>

        <h2>Commit Messages During Merge</h2>
        <p>When performing a 3-way merge, Git will generate a default commit message for the merge commit, which you can
            modify if necessary. This message usually indicates which branch was merged into the current branch.</p>
        <p>After merging has been performed from tes branch to master branch it is recommended to sync or again merge
            your test branch with master as well
            Just checkout to <code>test branch</code> and use <code>git merge master</code> and finally
            <code>git push origin test</code> to update <code>remote/test</code> branch.
        </p>
