        <h1>Pushing to GitHub & Collaborating</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Setting Up a Remote Repository</h2>
        <p>Before you can push your local commits to GitHub, you need to link your local repository to a remote
            repository. To
            add a remote repository, use:</p>
        <pre><code>git remote add origin &lt;repository-URL></code></pre>
        <p>Here, <code>origin</code> is the default name for the remote repository, and the <code>repository-URL</code>
            is the URL of your GitHub repository. You only need to do this once per repository.</p>

        <h2>Pushing Commits to GitHub</h2>
        <p>After committing changes locally, you can push them to your remote GitHub repository. To push commits from
            your local branch to a remote branch, use the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>git push origin &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>For example, to push changes from a branch named <code>feature-branch</code> to GitHub:</p>
        <pre><code>git push origin feature-branch</code></pre>
        <p>If you're pushing to the remote repository for the first time, and the branch does not exist on GitHub, Git
            will create the branch remotely. If you need to push all your branches, use:</p>
        <pre><code>git push --all origin</code></pre>

        <h2>Working with Pull Requests (PR)</h2>
        <p>When working in teams or on collaborative projects, you often create branches for new features or bug fixes.
            After pushing your changes to GitHub, you can create a pull request (PR) to propose that your changes be
            merged into the main branch. This is a common practice in collaborative development, as it allows team
            members to review your changes before merging.</p>
        <p>Steps to create a pull request:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Push your changes to a branch on GitHub.</li>
            <li>Go to the GitHub repository in your browser.</li>
            <li>Click on the "Pull Requests" tab, and then "New Pull Request".</li>
            <li>Select the branch you want to merge into the main branch.</li>
            <li>Add a title and description for the pull request, and submit it for review.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once the pull request is reviewed and approved, it can be merged into the main branch by either the author or
            a collaborator with merge privileges.</p>

        <h2>Pulling Changes from GitHub</h2>
        <p>To keep your local repository up to date with the latest changes from the remote repository, you can fetch
            and merge changes using <code>git pull</code>:</p>
        <pre><code>git pull origin &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>This will fetch the changes from the remote branch and merge them into your current local branch. For
            example, to pull changes from the <code>main</code> branch:</p>
        <pre><code>git pull origin main</code></pre>
        <p>Alternatively, you can separate fetching and merging into two steps by using:</p>
        <pre><code>git fetch origin
git merge origin/&lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>The <code>fetch</code> command will download the latest changes, and <code>merge</code> will combine them
            with your current branch.</p>

        <h2>Cloning a Repository</h2>
        <p>When you want to work on a project that is hosted on GitHub but not yet on your local machine, you can clone
            the repository using the <code>git clone</code> command:</p>
        <pre><code>git clone &lt;repository-URL&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>This will create a local copy of the entire repository. For example, to clone a repository named
            <code>my-repo</code> from GitHub:
        </p>
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/&lt;owner-username&gt;/&lt;owner-repo.git&gt;</code></pre>
        <pre><code>Example-&nbsp;git clone <a href="https://github.com/Ansh-Vikalp/GitMastery.git" target="_blank">https://github.com/Ansh-Vikalp/GitMastery.git</a></code></pre>

        <h2>Managing Collaborators</h2>
        <p>When collaborating on a GitHub repository, it's essential to manage collaborators effectively. You can invite
            others to your repository by going to the "Settings" tab on GitHub, clicking "Collaborators," and adding
            their GitHub usernames. Once invited, they will have the ability to push, pull, and merge changes in the
            repository.</p>

        <h2>Forking a Repository</h2>
        <p>If you don't have permission to push directly to a repository, you can fork it. Forking creates a copy of the
            repository under your GitHub account, allowing you to make changes and submit pull requests to the original
            repository. To fork a repository:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to the repository page on GitHub.</li>
            <li>Click the "Fork" button at the top right.</li>
            <li>After making changes in your forked repository, you can submit a pull request to the original repository
                for review.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Handling Merge Conflicts when Collaborating</h2>
        <p>When multiple collaborators are working on the same repository, conflicts can occur if two or more people
            change the same parts of the code. After pulling changes, you might need to resolve conflicts manually, as
            described in the "Merging & Resolving Conflicts" section.</p>
        <p>To handle a conflict after pulling changes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Edit the conflicting files to resolve the differences.</li>
            <li>Stage the resolved files with <code>git add</code>.</li>
            <li>Commit the resolved conflicts with <code>git commit</code>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Best Practices for Collaboration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Commit Frequently:</strong> Make small, frequent commits to avoid large, complicated merge
                requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Meaningful Commit Messages:</strong> Write clear and descriptive commit messages for better
                history
                tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>Branching Strategy:</strong> Use a clear branching strategy, such as GitFlow or Feature
                Branches, to avoid
                messy conflicts and maintain an organized workflow.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Reviews:</strong> Always have someone review your pull request before merging to maintain
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sync branches:</strong> After the pull request has been merged by the owner make sure to sync
                all your remote and local branches
                with owner remote repo. Use cmd:
                <pre><code>git add remote upstream https://github.com/&lt;owner-username&gt;/&lt;owner-repo.git&gt; </code></pre>
            </li>

            <pre><code># sync your master branch locally with owner master if pull request made from master branch after merging locally
git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
#finally push changes to your remote forked
git push origin master
</code></pre>
            <pre><code># sync your test branch locally with owner master if pull request made from test branch after merging locally
git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
#finally push changes to your remote forked
git push origin test
</code></pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
