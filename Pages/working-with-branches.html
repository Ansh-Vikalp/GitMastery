    </header>

        <h2>What are Branches?</h2>
        <p>Branches in Git are separate workspaces that allow you to work on specific tasks (such as feature development
            or bug fixes) without affecting the main codebase. By default, the main branch is usually named
            <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>, and developers often create additional branches to keep the
            development isolated. This allows for parallel development and easy integration later through merging.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating a New Branch</h2>
        <p>To create a new branch, use the <code>git branch</code> command followed by the branch name:</p>
        <pre><code>git branch &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>This will create a new branch but will not switch to it automatically. If you want to create and switch to
            the branch immediately, use:</p>
        <pre><code>git checkout -b &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>

        <h2>Switching Between Branches</h2>
        <p>Once you have multiple branches, you can switch between them using the <code>git checkout</code> command:</p>
        <pre><code>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>

        <h2>Listing Branches</h2>
        <p>To see a list of all the branches in your repository, use the <code>git branch</code> command:</p>
        <pre><code>git branch
*<span style="color: green;"> master</span>
testing</code></pre>
        <p>The current branch you're on will be indicated by an asterisk (*) next to its name.</p>
        <p>To see more detail verbose of branch is to check which branch is set as upstream to orgin:</p>
        <pre><code>git branch -vv</code>
* <span style="color: green;">master</span> e391cc5 <span style="color: blue;">[origin/master]</span> added codes
testing 1e20859  One file renamed</pre>


        <h2>Deleting a Branch</h2>
        <p>Once a branch is no longer needed, you can delete it to keep your repository clean. To delete a branch that
            has already been merged, use:</p>
        <pre><code>git branch -d &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>If the branch has not been merged and you want to force delete it, use:</p>
        <pre><code>git branch -D &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>

        <h2>Renaming a Branch</h2>
        <p>If you want to rename the current branch, you can do so with:</p>
        <pre><code>git branch -m &lt;new-branch-name&gt;</code></pre>

        <h2>Remote Branches</h2>
        <p>Branches that exist on a remote repository (such as GitHub) can be fetched with <code>git fetch</code>. To
            switch to a remote branch, use:</p>
        <pre><code>git checkout -t origin/&lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>This will create a local tracking branch that follows the remote branch.</p>
