        <h2>Working Directory</h2>
        <p>The working directory contains all the files in your project. You make changes to files here, but Git doesn't
            start tracking those changes until you add them to the staging area.</p>


        <h2>1. Untracked Files</h2>
        <p>Untracked files are files that Git is not yet tracking. They exist in your working directory but have not
            been added to the Git index (staging area) for tracking.</p>

        <p><strong>How It Happens:</strong><br>
            When you create a new file in your project directory, it will initially be untracked.<br>
            Git will recognize that the file exists but won’t include it in version control unless explicitly added.</p>

        <p><strong>Status in git status:</strong></p>
        <pre>
Untracked files:
  (use <code>git add &lt;file&gt;...</code> to include in what will be committed)
    newfile.txt
    </pre>

        <p><strong>Actions:</strong><br>
            Track the file by using the <code>git add</code> command:</p>
        <pre>
<code>git add newfile.txt</code></pre>
        <p>After adding, the file moves to the staged state.</p>

        <h2>2. Modified Files</h2>

        <p>A file becomes "modified" when it is being tracked by Git (i.e., it has been committed or staged before) and
            has been changed in the working directory but not yet staged for the next commit.</p>

        <p><strong>How It Happens:</strong><br>
            When you edit a tracked file, Git detects the change but won’t automatically include it in the next commit
            unless you explicitly stage it.</p>

        <p><strong>Status in git status:</strong></p>
        <pre>
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use <code>git add &lt;file&gt;...</code> to update what will be committed)
    modified:   myfile.txt
    </pre>

        <p><strong>Actions:</strong><br>
            Stage the file by using the <code>git add</code> command:</p>
        <pre>
<code>git add myfile.txt</code></pre>
        <p>This moves the file from the modified state to the staged state.</p>

        <p>If you don’t want to keep the changes, you can discard them using:</p>
        <pre>
<code>git restore myfile.txt</code></pre>

        <h2>3. Staged Files</h2>

        <p>A file becomes "staged" when changes to it are added to the staging area (also called the index). These
            changes are now prepared to be included in the next commit.</p>

        <p><strong>How It Happens:</strong><br>
            After modifying a file, you use <code>git add</code> to stage it. This tells Git to include the changes in
            the next commit.</p>

        <p><strong>Status in git status:</strong></p>
        <pre>
Changes to be committed:
  (use <code>git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...</code> to unstage)
    modified:   myfile.txt
    </pre>

        <p><strong>Actions:</strong><br>
            Commit the file by using the <code>git commit</code> command:</p>
        <pre>
<code>git commit -m "Updated myfile.txt"</code></pre>
        <p>This moves the file from the staged state to the committed state.</p>

        <p>If you want to unstage the file, you can use:</p>
        <pre><code>git restore --staged myfile.txt</code></pre>
        <p>This will move the file back to the modified state.</p>

        <h2>4. Committed Files</h2>

        <p>A file is "committed" when the changes have been saved to the local Git repository. This means that the
            current state of the file is safely stored in Git’s version history.</p>

        <p><strong>How It Happens:</strong><br>
            After staging changes, you use <code>git commit</code> to record them permanently in the repository's
            history.</p>

        <p><strong>Status in git status:</strong></p>
        <pre>
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
    </pre>

        <p><strong>Actions:</strong><br>
            No immediate action is needed if the file is in the committed state.</p>

        <p>You can view the commit history and see the committed changes using <code>git log</code>:</p>
        <pre>
<code>git log</code></pre>

        <p>If you make new changes to a committed file, it moves back to the modified state.</p>



        <h2>5. Both Modified (Conflict)</h2>
        <p>
            In some situations, especially during merges, you may run into conflicts where the same file is modified by
            both you and someone else.</p>

        <p><strong>Status in git status:</strong></p>
        <pre>
$ git status
On branch main
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use <code>git merge --abort</code> to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use <code>git add &lt;file&gt;...</code> to mark resolution)
    both modified:   conflictfile.txt
    </pre>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
            <code>Unmerged paths:</code> The file <code>conflictfile.txt</code> has conflicts because both you and the
            other branch have modified it.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Action:</strong><br>
            You must manually resolve the conflicts, then mark the file as resolved by adding it again with
            <code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code>. Finally, commit the merge.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Deleted Files</h2>
        <p>If you delete a file from the working directory, Git will recognize that it’s been removed and mark it as
            deleted.</p>

        <p><strong>Status in git status:</strong></p>
        <pre>
$ git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use <code>git add/rm &lt;file&gt;...</code> to update what will be committed)
    deleted:    deletedfile.txt
    </pre>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
            <code>deleted:</code> <code>deletedfile.txt</code>: The file <code>deletedfile.txt</code> has been deleted
            but is not yet staged for the deletion to be recorded.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Action:</strong><br>
            You need to stage the deletion using <code>git rm &lt;file&gt;</code> (or <code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code>
            for changes) and then commit it.</p>

        <h2>7. Staged Deleted Files</h2>
        <p>If you delete a file and then stage the deletion, Git will show it as staged for deletion.</p>

        <p><strong>Status in git status:</strong></p>
        <pre>
$ git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use <code>git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...</code> to unstage)
    deleted:    deletedfile.txt
    </pre>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
            <code>deleted:</code> <code>deletedfile.txt</code>: The file has been deleted and the deletion is staged.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Action:</strong><br>
            You can commit this change to finalize the deletion.</p>

        <h2>8. Renamed Files</h2>
        <p>When you rename a file, Git will detect it and display the old and new filenames.</p>

        <p><strong>Status in git status:</strong></p>
        <pre>
$ git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use <code>git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...</code> to unstage)
    renamed:    oldname.txt -> newname.txt
    </pre>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
            <code>renamed:</code> <code>oldname.txt -> newname.txt</code>: Git has detected that
            <code>oldname.txt</code> has been renamed to <code>newname.txt</code> and the change is staged.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Action:</strong><br>
            You can commit this change to record the file rename.</p>

        <h2>9. Clean Working Directory</h2>
        <p>After you have committed all changes, your working directory will be clean, and <code>git status</code> will
            indicate this.</p>

        <p><strong>Status in git status:</strong></p>
        <pre>
$ git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
    </pre>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
            <code>nothing to commit, working tree clean:</code> All changes have been committed, and there are no
            untracked files or modifications.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Stashed Changes</h2>
        <p>If you temporarily store changes with <code>git stash</code>, the <code>git status</code> command will show
            a clean working directory, but the stashed changes are hidden and can be reapplied later.</p>

        <p><strong>Status in git status:</strong></p>
        <pre>
$ git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
    </pre>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
            Even though your working directory is clean, your changes are stored in the stash and can be restored later
            with <code>git stash pop</code>.</p>

        <h2>11. Files Ignored by Git</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, you may have files that you want Git to ignore (e.g., configuration files, build artifacts).
            These are specified in a <code>.gitignore</code> file. Ignored files do not show up in the
            <code>git status</code> output.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example .gitignore file:</strong></p>
        <pre>
<code>node_modules/
*.log
.env</code>
    </pre>

        <p>These files won’t appear when you run <code>git status</code> and won’t be tracked by Git.</p>
