        <h2>Merging Branches</h2>
        <p>To combine changes from one branch into another, use the <code>git merge</code> command:</p>
        <pre><code>git merge <branch-name></code></pre>
        <p>This will merge the specified branch into your current branch.</p>

        <h2>Fast-Forward Merge</h2>
        <p>If no new commits have been made to the current branch, Git will perform a fast-forward merge, simply moving
            the branch pointer forward.</p>

        <h2>3-Way Merge</h2>
        <p>If both branches have unique commits, Git will perform a 3-way merge. In cases where the same lines were
            modified in both branches, a merge conflict may occur.</p>

        <h2>Resolving Conflicts</h2>
        <p>If a merge conflict occurs, Git will prompt you to manually resolve it. After resolving conflicts, stage the
            file and commit the merge:</p>
        <pre><code>git add <filename>git commit</code></pre>
